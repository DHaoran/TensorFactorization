# NTFLib
Sparse Beta-Divergence Tensor Factorization Library

![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/cemoody/NTFLib.svg?branch=master)

Based off of this [beta-NTF project](https://code.google.com/p/beta-ntf/) this library is 
specially-built to handle tensors where the sparsity implies missing data.
